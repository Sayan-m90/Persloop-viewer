	cerr << "specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the" << endl;
	cerr << "Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You" << endl;

	cerr << "you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge" << endl;

	cerr << "it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do" << endl;

	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid" << endl;

	cerr << "rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for" << endl;
	cerr << "you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis" << endl;
	cerr << "or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave" << endl;
	cerr << "you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source" << endl;

	cerr << "complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them" << endl;
	cerr << "with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling" << endl;
	cerr << "it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights." << endl;

	cerr << "modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know" << endl;
	cerr << "that what they have is not the original version, so that the original" << endl;
	cerr << "author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be" << endl;
	cerr << "introduced by others." << endl;

	cerr << "  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of" << endl;
	cerr << "any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot" << endl;

	cerr << "restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that" << endl;
	cerr << "any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be" << endl;
	cerr << "consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the" << endl;

	cerr << "General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and" << endl;
	cerr << "is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use" << endl;
	cerr << "this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those" << endl;

	cerr << "entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General" << endl;
	cerr << "Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with" << endl;
	cerr << "the library." << endl;

	cerr << "  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it" << endl;
	cerr << "does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General" << endl;
	cerr << "Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less" << endl;
	cerr << "of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages" << endl;
	cerr << "are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many" << endl;
	cerr << "libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain" << endl;
	cerr << "special circumstances." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to" << endl;
	cerr << "encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes" << endl;
	cerr << "a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be" << endl;
	cerr << "allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free" << endl;
	cerr << "library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this" << endl;
	cerr << "case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free" << endl;
	cerr << "software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free" << endl;
	cerr << "programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of" << endl;
	cerr << "free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in" << endl;
	cerr << "non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU" << endl;
	cerr << "operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating" << endl;
	cerr << "system." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the" << endl;
	cerr << "users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is" << endl;

	cerr << "that program using a modified version of the Library." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and" << endl;
	cerr << "modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a" << endl;
	cerr << "\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The" << endl;

	cerr << "program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or" << endl;
	cerr << "other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of" << endl;
	cerr << "this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\")." << endl;
	cerr << "Each licensee is addressed as \"you\"." << endl;

	cerr << endl;

	cerr << "and installation of the library." << endl;

	cerr << "  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not" << endl;
	cerr << "covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of" << endl;
	cerr << "running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from" << endl;
	cerr << "such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based" << endl;
	cerr << "on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for" << endl;
	cerr << "writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does" << endl;
	cerr << "and what the program that uses the Library does." << endl;
	cerr << "  " << endl;
	cerr << "  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's" << endl;
	cerr << "complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that" << endl;
	cerr << "you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an" << endl;
	cerr << "appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact" << endl;

	cerr << "and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a" << endl;

	cerr << "" << endl;
	cerr << "  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion" << endl;
	cerr << "of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and" << endl;
	cerr << "distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1" << endl;
	cerr << "above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:" << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "    a) The modified work must itself be a software library." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices" << endl;

	cerr << "    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no" << endl;
	cerr << "    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a" << endl;
	cerr << "    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses" << endl;
	cerr << "    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility" << endl;
	cerr << "    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that," << endl;
	cerr << "    in the event an application does not supply such function or" << endl;
	cerr << "    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of" << endl;
	cerr << "    its purpose remains meaningful." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has" << endl;
	cerr << "    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the" << endl;
	cerr << "    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any" << endl;
	cerr << "    application-supplied function or table used by this function must" << endl;
	cerr << "    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square" << endl;
	cerr << "    root function must still compute square roots.)" << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If" << endl;
	cerr << "identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library," << endl;
	cerr << "and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in" << endl;
	cerr << "themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those" << endl;
	cerr << "sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you" << endl;
	cerr << "distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based" << endl;
	cerr << "on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of" << endl;
	cerr << "this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the" << endl;
	cerr << "entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote" << endl;
	cerr << "it." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest" << endl;
	cerr << "your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to" << endl;
	cerr << "exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or" << endl;
	cerr << "collective works based on the Library." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library" << endl;
	cerr << "with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of" << endl;
	cerr << "a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under" << endl;
	cerr << "the scope of this License." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public" << endl;
	cerr << "License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do" << endl;
	cerr << "this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so" << endl;
	cerr << "that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2," << endl;
	cerr << "instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the" << endl;
	cerr << "ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify" << endl;
	cerr << "that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in" << endl;
	cerr << "these notices." << endl;
	cerr << "" << endl;
	cerr << "  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for" << endl;
	cerr << "that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all" << endl;
	cerr << "subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of" << endl;
	cerr << "the Library into a program that is not a library." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or" << endl;
	cerr << "derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form" << endl;
	cerr << "under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany" << endl;
	cerr << "it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which" << endl;
	cerr << "must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a" << endl;
	cerr << "medium customarily used for software interchange." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy" << endl;

	cerr << "source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to" << endl;
	cerr << "distribute the source code, even though third parties are not" << endl;
	cerr << "compelled to copy the source along with the object code." << endl;

	cerr << "linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a" << endl;
	cerr << "work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and" << endl;
	cerr << "therefore falls outside the scope of this License." << endl;
	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library" << endl;
	cerr << "creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it" << endl;

	cerr << "that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a" << endl;
	cerr << "derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not." << endl;
	cerr << "Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be" << endl;
	cerr << "linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The" << endl;
	cerr << "threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law." << endl;
	cerr << endl;

	cerr << endl;
	cerr << "  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may" << endl;
